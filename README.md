# TennisGame
Arcade Classic in JavaScript on Canvas. Programmed my first simple game in JavaScript. No special software required, only a text editor and a browser. 
By creating this game, youll learn :
1. Display, position, and move filled shapes for retro and prototype gameplay
2. Move a ball around your game space such that it bounces off boundaries
3. Handle real-time mouse input
4. Detect and respond to simple collisions
5. Program very basic artificial intelligence
6. Keep and display score during play
7. Understand the subtle, key difference between a classic game in this style which is fun to play versus one that isn't
8. Define and code a win condition and end state for your game
